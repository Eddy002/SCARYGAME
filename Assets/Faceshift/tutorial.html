<h1>Unity Plugin Tutorial</h1>

<h2>Version 1.1</h2>
<p>Create stunning animations with motion capture at your desk thanks to faceshift,
a markerless mocap system which uses a depth camera to capture an actor's
expressions. Using a FACS-based face model, faceshift estimates the actor's 
facial muscle activations.</p>

<p>The faceshift for unity plugin takes (previously tracked) clips
and lets you map them onto arbitrary blendshape-based rigs. The
package contains example scenes and tutorials to get you started, and
you can <a href="http://www.faceshift.com/get-trial/">use the faceshift studio trial</a>
to generate your own motion capture sequences.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>The faceshift plugin is located in the Unity Asset Store under the
category "Editor Extension &gt; Animation". Download and
import the plugin from the Asset store. The package content should be
displayed in the bottom left panel, together with the other assets.</p>

<h2>Setting up the scene</h2>
<p>The faceshift plugin provides an example scene containing a model, a
spotlight, and a camera. Load the example scene by double-clicking the
"Macaw" icon in "Examples &gt; Scenes". You should now see the macaw
character in the scene, as well as the spotlight and the camera objects.</p>

<h2>Get the GUI</h2>
<p>Select the macaw model in the Hierarchy panel on the left of the interface.
From here, go to "Faceshift &gt; Scripts" and drag the
"faceshift" script onto the Inspector panel on the right to
add the faceshift component. The faceshift user interface is now
loaded and you can start using it.</p>

<h2>Loading the clip</h2>
<p>The assumption here is that you have already created a clip
using faceshift studio. Should this sound new to you,
please refer to our <a href="http://support.faceshift.com/support/solutions/folders/198189">tutorials page</a>
and learn how to create and export an animation with faceshift studio.</p>
<p>The "Examples" folder contains a sample clip file that you can
use for testing.</p>
<p>Click on the "Load fsb (faceshift clip)" button and select the
clip you want to load.</p>

<h2>Retargeting</h2>
<p>The retargeting step allows you to create the mapping between the faceshift
animation and your Unity character. In order to do so, you have the
possibility to map blendshapes as well as translation and rotation
joints. Use the corresponding "Add translation mapping",
"Add rotation mapping", and "Add blend shape mapping"
buttons to define all the mappings you need.</p>
<p>The "Examples" folder contains a sample retargeting file
("macaw-retargeting.fst") that you can directly load using
the "Load retargeting" button to see how it is done for
this macaw model. You can play with the coefficients to change the
relation between corresponding blendshapes and see how it would alter
the animation output.</p>

<h2>Create the Animation</h2>
<p>As soon as you completed the retargeting part, you are ready to animate
your character.</p>
<p>Select the "Attach as .anim to object" button and give a name to
your new animation file. The file will be stored as an ".anim"
file in your Assets directory.</p>

<h3><u>Important:</u></h3>
<p>to make sure this works correctly when you use your own scene, do the
following in Unity3D:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the "project" window in the Assets hierarchy, click on your fbx model</li>
  <li>In the inspector, you should see now the Import Settings of your model</li>
  <li>In the "Rig" tab for the "Animation Type" the value "Legacy"</li>
</ol>

<p>You can now hit the "play" button to enter the Game mode of Unity and see
your character being animated.</p>
